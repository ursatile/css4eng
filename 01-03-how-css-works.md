## Properties and Values

CSS, fundamentally, allows us to do three things:

1. Select an element, or elements, on our page
2. Identify a property that is relevant to that element
3. Give that property to a value, which controls how the browser will display it.

The simplest way to do this is what's called `inline CSS`. We're going to find an element on our page - say, that heading 1 - and we're going to add a `style` attribute containing a property - `color` - and a value - `green`. You can probably figure out what that means, right

* Inline vs internal vs external
