	<h1>Cats of Unsplash</h1>
		<p>This section includes three cats</p>

		<p>Cats are fascinating creatures known for their independence, agility, and
			mysterious nature. They have been companions to humans for thousands of
			years, originally valued for their hunting skills in keeping homes free of
			rodents.</p>

		<p>These remarkable felines possess an incredible sense of balance and
			flexibility,
			allowing them to navigate narrow spaces and land gracefully on their feet.
			Their
			keen senses, particularly their night vision and acute hearing, make them
			excellent
			hunters even in low-light conditions.</p>

		<p>In a groundbreaking experiment, Google researchers trained a massive
			neural network using 10 million randomly selected YouTube video thumbnails
			without any human labeling or guidance. The network, consisting of over 1
			billion connections, was left to identify patterns on its own. Remarkably,
			one of the first concepts it learned to recognize was cats - developing
			what researchers called a "cat neuron" that activated specifically when
			feline features were detected. This unsupervised learning breakthrough
			demonstrated that artificial neural networks could spontaneously develop
			the ability to identify and categorize objects in much the same way
			biological brains do, marking a significant milestone in machine learning
			and computer vision.</p>

		<p>Despite their charm, cats can sometimes display behaviors that seem
			deliberately troublesome - knocking items off tables, ignoring their
			owners when called, or demanding attention at inconvenient times. These
			independent creatures follow their own agenda and aren't afraid to show
			their displeasure when things don't go their way.</p>
