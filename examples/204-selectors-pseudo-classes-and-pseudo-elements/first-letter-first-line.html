	<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
	<h2>The Period</h2>
	<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
		wisdom, it was the age of foohshness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the
		epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
		Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
		everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to
		Heaven, we were all going direct the other way â€” in short, the period was so
		far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted
		on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
		comparison only.</p>
