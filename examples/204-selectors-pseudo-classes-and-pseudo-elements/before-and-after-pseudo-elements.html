	<h2>Marillion: <em>Brave</em></h2>
	<p class="positive">A masterpiece of progressive rock storytelling, “Brave”
		showcases Marillion at their creative peak. The album’s conceptual depth
		explores themes of isolation and urban alienation with remarkable
		sensitivity, while Steve Hogarth’s vocals soar over intricate musical
		arrangements that seamlessly blend atmospheric passages with powerful
		crescendos.</p>
	<p class="negative">“Brave” suffers from occasional self-indulgence
		that may alienate casual listeners. At times the concept feels heavy-handed,
		and some tracks meander without clear direction. The album’s ambitious scope
		sometimes works against it, creating moments where pretension overshadows
		the genuine emotional core that makes Marillion’s best work so compelling.
