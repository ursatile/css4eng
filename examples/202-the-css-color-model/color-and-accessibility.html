	<p>Red-green <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness">colour
			blindness</a> affects about 8% of men and 0.5% of women,
		making it the most common colour vision deficiency. People with it struggle
		to distinguish reds, greens, and related shades. Everyday tasks—like reading
		colour-coded charts or traffic lights—can be challenging, but accessible
		design can greatly improve usability.
