	<h1>Showcasing CSS Variable Fonts</h1>
	<p>In which we discuss the potential of variable fonts, their ability to
		provide multiple font variations within a single file, and how they enable
		dynamic typography adjustments for responsive design and enhanced user
		experiences.</p>
	<h2>What’s The Big Idea?</h2>
	<p>Instead of having to provide multiple versions of a font, which means
		multiple files,
		which means multiple HTTP requests, we can provide a single variable font
		and
		then create the weights and variations we need on the client.</p>
	<p>It’s a nice idea, you must admit.</p>
	<h3>Well? Does It Work?</h3>
	<p>I guess? Sometimes? It's temperamental, to say the least, but with a bit
		of patience and the right font files, you can make it work. Mostly.
