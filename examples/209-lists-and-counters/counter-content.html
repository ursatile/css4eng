	<p>Weight distribution must be balanced to ensure comfortable playing position
		and prevent neck dive when worn with a strap.</p>
	<h3>Routing and Cavities</h3>
	<p>Electronics cavity shall allow for standard humbucker and single-coil
		pickup routing.</p>
	<p>Control cavity shall accommodate at least 2 potentiometers and a 5-way
		switch.</p>
	<p>All cavities must be properly shielded with copper foil or conductive paint
		to minimize electromagnetic interference.</p>
	<h2>Neck Construction</h2>
	<h3>Material</h3>
	<p>Neck shall be made from maple or mahogany.</p>
	<p>Fingerboard shall be rosewood, maple, or ebony.</p>
	<p>Wood joints between neck and fingerboard must be seamless and reinforced
		with appropriate adhesives rated for musical instrument construction.</p>

	<p>Tuners shall provide at least 18:1 gear ratio for tuning stability.</p>
	<h3>Electronics</h3>
	<p>Pickups shall be shielded and soldered to minimize noise.</p>
	<p>Output jack shall be 1/4” mono standard.</p>
	<h2>Replaceability</h2>
	<h3>Pickups</h3>

		cleaning.</p>
	<h2>Electrical Safety</h2>
	<h3>Grounding</h3>
	<p>All metal components shall be grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
	<h3>Insulation</h3>
	<p>Wires must be insulated with heat-resistant sheathing.</p>
	<h2>Physical Safety</h2>
