So far, we've learned about the building blocks of the CSS language - selectors, properties, and values - and the tools and techniques we can use to inspect and manipulate those properties.

Time to dive into how CSS actually works, and why.

## The Grain of the Web

If you've ever worked with wood, or fabric, you'll know that these materials have a *grain*; an intrinsic structure that's aligned in a particular direction. Experienced crafters know how to work *with* the grain of the material, because it yields better results; working against, or across, the grain, and you'll end up with all sorts of problems.

The web also has a grain; a natural direction and flow, derived from typesetting conventions used in many Western countries. Text starts at the top left corner of the page; lines read left to right, with each new line starting back at the left
