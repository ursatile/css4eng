In the previous section, we learned the rudiments of CSS syntax, and how to associate styles with our web content.

Before we go any further, let's learn about some tools, tricks, and techniques we'll be using during the rest of the course, to help us develop, test, and debug CSS rules.

We're going to be using Visual Studio Code as our code editor throughout this course; it's free, it's cross-platform, and it has built-in CSS language features for formatting and syntax highlighting CSS.

## The Feedback Loop

When you're writing CSS, the vast majority of your time will be spent checking that rules have done the right thing - which means reloading the page in your browser and seeing what's changed. The faster this feedback loop, the faster you'll be able to get things working properly.

The ideal rendering model here is sometimes called "live refresh": you make a change in your editor, and it appears instantly in the browser window.

Now, you might already have a setup like that, using something like Vite or Webpack - if you do; awesome. That'll work just fine. If not, here's a couple of options to try out.
